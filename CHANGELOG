snowplow-web 0.13.3 (2023-03-24)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release which fixes an issue with enabling contexts on databricks. 

## Features
- Fix databricks context macro (Close #181)

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.13.2 (2023-02-27)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release with the purpose to unblock those Redshift/Postgres users who are using enrichments. The macros we introduced were not correctly parsing the table aliases for the enrichments loaded in Redshift/Postgres. This has now been fixed.

## Features
- Fix whitespace issue on redshift sessions (Close #166)
- Fix context prefix argument usage (Close #167)

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-web 0.13.1 (2023-02-24)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This is a patch release with the purpose to unblock those Redshift/Postgres users whose loaders do not send `load_tstamp` field to their events table: they use `Postgres loader` or `RDB Loader` below v4.0.0. Please note that they will not be able to use the Consent models but the general web model will still be supported.

## Upgrading
Apart from bumping the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file, impacted users will need to set a newly introduced variable: `snowplow__enable_load_tstamp` to `false`.


snowplow-web 0.13.0 (2023-02-22)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds Databricks, Redshift and Postgres support for the optional Consent module. As a breaking change we are decoupling sessions from pageviews, please refer to the below breakdown on this. It also removes unnecessary `domain_userid` tests which would fail due to anonymous tracking. We also fix some integration tests.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The way we generate the sessions table has changed, breaking the dependency on the page views table and instead building directly from page view and ping events. This means we now include sessions that contain only page-pings, and all stray page pings in sessions, see our [docs](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-web-data-model/#stray-page-pings) for more information about what this means. You do not need to make any changes to your tables or data, but **you will likely see an increase in the number of sessions overall**, and may see a small increase in absolute and engaged time on individual sessions (to account for those starting with a stray page ping). Any reporting off the sessions table should be interpreted accordingly, or the data re-processed (see [here](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models-2) for how to reprocess a single model).

## ðŸš¨ Prerequisite Alert ðŸš¨
Redshift/Postgres users would need to use `RDB Loader v4.0.0` and above as the web model for them relies on the `load_tstamp` field from now on. The same dependency applies for the Consent module users regardles of warehouse as that field is utilised for the incremental logic.

## Features
- Fixed sessions being dependant on snowplow_web_user_mapping even when session stitching was disabled (Close #155)
- Added alias argument to the `filter_bots` macro for more flexibility
- Migrated engaged time to use device timestamps instead of derived to provide more accurate calculation when there is a delay between events being sent and the collector receiving them
- Added `get_optional_fields` macro to reduce duplication of calls to contexts across models
- Added missing adapter support for Consent module (Close #148)

## Under the hood
- Tidied up some macro inheritance
- Improved macro documentation
- Improvements to integration test

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file, taking account of the breaking changes above.

snowplow-web 0.12.1 (2022-12-19)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds a new variable to ensure deterministic behaviour on page views when there are stray page pings.

## Features
Add option to limit page view metrics to a session (Close #96)

## Under The Hood

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. If you wish to keep the existing non-deterministic behaviour for page view processing, set the `snowplow__limit_page_views_to_session` variable to `false` in your `dbt_project.yml`

snowplow-web 0.12.0 (2022-12-08)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
**This release drops support for dbt versions below 1.3.** In order to support the new dbt-utils major release, we need to drop support for dbt versions below 1.3. As a result, we've stopped using macros from dbt-utils which removes the deprecation warnings users were seeing.

## Features
Drop support for dbt versions below 1.3 (Close #123)

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. **You will need dbt v1.3 at least to be able to use this version of the package.**

snowplow-web 0.11.0 (2022-12-07)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release optimises performance in Databricks for the `base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest`, bringing the behaviour in line with the mobile package. We also add standard actions to aid development and categorize issues better.

## Features
Add missing start_tstamp_date for `base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest` on Databricks (Close #132)
Add standard actions and templates

## Upgrading
To upgrade simply bump the snowplow-web version in your `packages.yml` file. If you are running the web package on **Databricks**, you will need to run the following SQL to take advantage of the performance optimizations in this release. Be sure to replace `{catalog_name}` with your catalog name if your environment is UC enabled, and remove it if not. Also be sure to replace `{manifest_schema}` with the name of the schema where your manifest is currently found.

```sql
CREATE TABLE {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest_tmp
    USING DELTA
    PARTITIONED BY (start_tstamp_date)
    tblproperties ('delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true' , 'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
    ) AS

    SELECT *,
            DATE(start_tstamp) as start_tstamp_date
    FROM {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;

ALTER TABLE {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest_tmp RENAME TO {catalog_name}.{manifest_schema}.snowplow_web_base_sessions_lifecycle_manifest;
```
