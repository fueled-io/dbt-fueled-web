# snowplow-web

This dbt package:

- Transforms and aggregates raw web event data collected from the [Snowplow JavaScript tracker][tracker-docs] into a set of derived tables: page views, sessions and users.
- Derives a mapping between user identifiers, allowing for 'session stitching' and the development of a single customer view.
- Processes **all web events incrementally**. It is not just constrained to page view events - any custom events you are tracking will also be incrementally processed.
- Is designed in a modular manner, allowing you to easily integrate your own custom SQL into the incremental framework provided by the package.

Please refer to the [doc site][snowplow-web-docs] for a full breakdown of the package.
